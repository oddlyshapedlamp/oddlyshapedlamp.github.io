  <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>The HTML tags are how you tell browsers that the page is written in HTML, and should be interpretted as such.</p>
    <p> Start all pages with &lt;html&gt; and end it with &lt;/html&gt; </p>
    <p>An example of when you would want to do this is whenever you write any page in html. IT has no visual impact on your page, and it is the first and last line of this page</p>
    
  <h3>Title</h3>
    <p>A title is what you use to give you page, well, a title. It is what is displayed at the top of your page</p>
    <p>You call them with the syntax &lt;title&gt; Title Text &lt;/Title&gt; </p>
    <p>An example of title is in this page, it is titled HTML reference page. This will be used in basically all websites</p>
  <h3>Body</h3>
    <p>The body is where you put the code, of your website, the meat and potatoes of a webpage. Everything that you see on this page, with the exception of the title I just mentioned, is inside the body tags at the beginning and end of the code. Everything goes in them spare the title </p>
    <p>You call this with the syntax &lt;body&gt; All of your lines of code &lt;/body&gt; </p>
  <h3>Head</h3>
    <p>The head tag is where you specify some of the top level stuff</p>
    <p>Some of the things you specify here is the title, any meta data, a link to a stylesheet of anything of that nature.</p>
    <p>You call this with the syntax &lt;head&gt; All of the stuff you want in your head &lt;/head&gt; </p>  
  <h3>Breaks</h3>
    <p>Breaks are things inside of paragraphs or other text you can use to break them up, like hitting retun. An example of how you would use them is when you want to go to a new line, within one paragraph tag</p>
    <p>In use, they <br> look something <br> like this.</p>
    <p>You call them with the syntax &lt;br&gt; within another tag </p>
  <h3>Lines</h3>
    <p>Lines are what you use when you want to put a line in your webpage. They are a line across your page</p>
    <p>You call them with the syntax &lt;hr&gt;</p>
    <p>Here is what they look like</p>
    <hr>
  <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
    <p>Paragraphs are how you print text to your website, just like this</p>
    <p>You call a lines with the syntax &lt;hr&gt;</p>    
  <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>Comments are a tool you can use to leave yourself or others messages in your code. They are text that the computer skips over and doesn't look at. A comment in proper syntax won't appear at all on your finished page. An example could be a description of what a certain part is, what something does, why you made a cetain choice</p>
    <p>You call them with the syntax &lt;!-- comment Text --&gt; </p>
  <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>Links are how you connect pages an other thigs to your page. An example is a link to a page with more information or a link to a page with a link back to the home page</p>
    <a href="google.com">This example link will take you to google.com</a>
    <p>You call them with the syntax &lt;a href="Link address">Text of link that is displayed on the page&lt;/a&gt; </p>
  <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>Adding images is how you put pictures on your page. An example of when you would want to use this is if you want to add visuals to spice up your page or provide pictures of what you are talking about</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a picture</p>
    <img src="http://images.all-free-download.com/images/graphiclarge/nice_flower_212471.jpg">
    <p>You call them with the syntax &lt;img src="image address"&gt;</p>
  <h3>List</h3>
    <p>Lists are how you put lists of thing on your websites, with bullet points or numbers. You might want to use this when you have a list of items to display. An example is listing the steps in a process, ordered and by number.</p>
    <p>There are two types of lists, unordered lists (ul) that show bullet points, and ordered lists (ol), that have numbers</p>
    <p>You call a lines with the syntax &lt;ol [or] ul&gt; List elements &lt;/ol [or ul]&gt; <br>The syntax for each list item is &lt;li&gt; item text &lt;/li&gt;</p>  
    <ul>
      <li>This</li>
      <li>is</li>
      <li>an</li>
      <li>unordered</li>
      <li>list</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>And</li>
      <li>this</li>
      <li>is</li>
      <li>a</li>
      <li>ordered</li>
      <li>list</li>
    </ol>
  <h3>Tables</h3>
    <p>Tables are like lists, but also with the ability to have additonal columns. There are lots of styles you can add to Tables</p>
    <p>Tables have several tags you need,&lt;table&gt; and &lt;/table&gt; to call a table. All of you table text goes inside that </p>
    <p>Next are your table headings, &lt;th&gt; Heading text &lt;/th&gt; for each heading.</p>
    <p>Then, you use &lt;tr&gt; and &lt;tr&gt; to make a row. You can put items inside the row</p>
    <p>lastly, inside the row, to put items you use &lt;td&gt; Item Text&lt;td&gt;</p>
    <p>An example of this is the quick tag help at the top of this page. You might want to usea table to show a set of teams and their records</p>
  <h3>Blocks (div)</h3>
    <p>Blocks have two possible uses. First, and primarily, they act as comtainers and allow you to have multiple styles. The second is that they return a line and act like a break</p>
    <p>You might want to use this when you need multiple styles, but don't want to use a stylesheet. Below is what it looks like</p>
    <div> This is what the text inside the div looks like</div>
    <p>The syntax of this is &lt;div&gt; Text and code inside the div &lt;/div&gt;</p>
  </body>
</html>
