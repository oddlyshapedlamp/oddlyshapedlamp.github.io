    <h2>Corn farming tecniques</h2>
    <p>Corn requires certain soils. For best results mix in compost in the autumn before the winter you plant. Don't start the seeds indoors. You want to plant them a few weeks after the last winter frost day. Required soil temperation, vaires by breed, but is in the low 60s. Seeds should be an inch deep, several inches apart, and rows 2.5 to 3 feet apart.</p>
    <p>You should think your plants when they are a couple inches tall. Tour soil needs to be drained well. In dry, conditions you need to keep the corn well watered. Corn should be preserevd right after it is harvested</p>

    <h2>Harvesting Techniques</h2>
    <p>Farmers harvest corn with a combine harvester. This does several jobs in an all in one tool. It cuts the crop, seperates the grain, and spreads the remaining material acorss the field. It revolutioned the way that crops were harvested.</p>
