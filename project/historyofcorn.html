    <h2>History of Corn</h2>
 <ul>
   <!--Corn history list. Later on is the video-->
      <li>Corn first started to be domesticated at what is estimated to be seven thousand years ago in South and Central America</li>
      <li>The intial plant it was domesticated was much smaller and had fewer kernals, spaced further apart</li>
      <li>Over thousands of years, it slowly became the corn we know today</li>
      <li>Maize (as a crop) spread south along the coast of Peru, and North to higher up in North America</li>
      <li>As Indians spread out (and some migrated to what is now the US) they brought maize along with them</li>
      <li>Corn became a major part of the natives diets</li>
      <li>Christopher Columbus brought corn to Europe from the first time after reaching the new world</li>
      <li>It is believed that corn was served at the first Thanksgiving</li>
      <li>Corn has now become the most grown crop in the America's</li>
      <li>Just as corn has changed over time, so has its uses. Over 40% of corn is now used for ethanol</li>
